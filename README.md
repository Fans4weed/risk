“My risk tolerance scales with who is at the table; if no one joins, I have to act alone and accept higher risk.”
# Risk-Share Invitation — fans4weed/risk

**One-sentence rule**  
*My risk tolerance scales with who is at the table; if no one joins by the deadline, I will act solo and accept all remaining risk.*

## Countdown

**Decision date:** **2024-08-01 07:34 UTC**  
If no Class A or Class B collaborator is confirmed by then, I proceed on my own (Class C).
frfrom now on countdown goes down.. my own clarity , staying logically in the state of fear is my clock
aprox: -5% / hour

## Risk classes

| Class | Who joins               | Risk split | Action mode                    |
|-------|-------------------------|------------|--------------------------------|
| **A** | Named partner(s) with veto power | 50 / 50 | Co-design & shared decisions  |
| **B** | Advisory observers      | 80 / 20 | Limited consultation           |
| **C** | No engagement           | 100 / 0 | Solo execution (higher risk)   |

## How to engage

1. **Direct message (preferred):**  
   - **Subject/first line:** `ohpämEYEI`  ← signals urgency & goodwill.  
   - Contact: **cointogether@tutamail.

---

## What you get

- Full access to design documents.  
- Shared decision rights (Class A) or advisory visibility (Class B).  
- A commitment that this work poses **no threat** to participants; transparency is the safety mechanism.

## What happens if you stay silent

Silence = acceptance of **Class C** outcome.  
I will proceed alone, bearing 100 % of the risk and responsibility.
